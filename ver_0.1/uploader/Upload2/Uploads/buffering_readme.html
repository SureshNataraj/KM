<h1>ASP Upload Gets a Speed Boost</h1>

<p>
Jacob Gilley's
<a href="http://www.asp101.com/articles/jacob/scriptupload.asp">Pure ASP File Upload</a>
is an effective, free method for uploading user files to your server.
Although well implemented, I found that the file I/O needed improvement.
Concatenation is quite slow in VBScript and it was actually faster to
write a single byte at a time to the disk than to concatenate the file
prior to saving.
</p>
<p>
Here Robbert Nix's
<a href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?lngWId=4&txtCodeId=7110">improved concatenation algorithm</a>
comes to the rescue.  I stumbled upon this algorithm when searching
for performance enhancements in VBScript.  Essentially Nix's code
allows Gilley's Pure ASP File Upload to return to concatenation as
a viable method for preparing the file prior to saving.
</p>
<p>
Two files are included with this implementation: <code>upload.asp</code>
and <code>buffering.inc</code>.
These files are meant to be incorporated with the existing distribution
for Gilley's Pure ASP File Upload.  The <code>upload.asp</code> file
replaces the existing version and the include file <code>buffering.inc</code>
is used to improve upload time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> if you replace your existing
version of upload.asp you <b>must</b> also copy buffering.inc to the same
directory! No changes in existing upload pages are required to take
advantage of this upgrade.
